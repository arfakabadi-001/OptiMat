# OptiMat – Intelligent Material Selection & Optimization System

## Project Overview
**OptiMat** is a Python-powered system designed to assist engineers, researchers, and students in **making data-driven material selection decisions**. Selecting the right material often involves evaluating multiple parameters and constraints, which can be time-consuming and prone to error. OptiMat solves this challenge by automating the filtering, ranking, and recommendation process, providing **optimized, reliable, and interpretable results**.

## Problem Statement
Engineering material selection can be complex:
- Multiple materials with overlapping properties
- Conflicting constraints (e.g., strength vs weight)
- Manual analysis is time-consuming and error-prone

**OptiMat addresses these problems by:**
1. Allowing users to define **custom constraints** on material properties  
2. Automatically **filtering materials** that meet the criteria  
3. **Ranking the filtered materials** using a weighted scoring system  
4. Delivering **clear recommendations** for informed engineering decisions  

This ensures efficient, optimized, and reproducible material selection.
